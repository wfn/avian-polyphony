### Cute ridiculous bird "ecology" sandbox.

Project can be maybe possibly used to further prototype ideas atop this as well as use as basis for exploring some half-simulation-half-flaky-aesthetics sandbox concepts; maybe.

Initial repo (apart these notices here and there) is output of `gemini-3-pro-preview` model in AI Studio and really is just my wanting to play around with it; with vibe coding. There, I said it.

# Warning

> [!CAUTION]
> "is output of `gemini-3-pro-preview` model in AI Studio" is not an exaggeration. Use **CAUTION, COMMON SENSE and DO NOT TRUST** code or docs in `DESCRIPTION` and `ARCHITECTURE`.

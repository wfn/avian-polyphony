# Project documentation

Main docs (in particular the **Docs** below) are absolutely totally not 98-100% generated by LLM. Totally reviewed and trust me bro it's super professional.

In other words, this is just a quick web app sandbox experiment using a nifty LLM agent powered sandbox, be careful what you read and what you deploy please; I mean it.

## Docs

> [!CAUTION]
> Again, **do not blindly trust please**

1. **Overall description**: What this is ("Product" PoV)
   - [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION.md)
2. **Technical docs**
   - [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) (incl. overall overview as well as lower level tech design, give or take)
   - LLM agent should be kindly asked to write/expand tests of multiple kinds
     - incl. some or other sort of end-to-end *useful* test suite
     - and then one could proudly add a reference to that here
3. **Docs for LLM**
   - [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) - wrote initial version myself, it includes notes about direction I want to go (I think) as well
4. **Roadmap & Planning**

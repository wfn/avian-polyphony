## interim notes: future areas

2025-11-20 - wrote the below by hand, but also put it into claude code for it to garner understanding of general vision, possible future areas, give feedback, refine the quick notes/writeup below, and record into a more refined separate doc. => asked claude to write to [FUTURE_WORK.md in docs dir](../FUTURE_WORK.md)

## quick list

  1. UI test automation base / setup - open to ideas what realistically one could expect to test here, but at the very least some sanity tests - both quick initial ones as well as -
  eventually ideally - UI/UX end-to-end tests using for example Playwright or similar (and also perhaps not only UI/UX end-to-end tests - open to ideas - and also the quick tests you
  wrote (more like unit tests) I would also like to keep and start collecting)
  2. UI improvements (for starters, making all UI components/widgets viewable together at the same time incl. bird/species info box, rearranging layout / how these widgets stack next to
  each other); other UI improvements
  3. Larger UI changes / features - from ability to change camera angle when following individual bird to render distance to whatever else
  4. Visual quality / rendering / overall graphics and graphical feel improvements
  5. Audio improvements incl. how birds sound; but also other background and various sounds and how they are modulated, filtered etc.
  6. Composable plugin-style ecology/population/evolutionary dynamics/systems framework where different behaviours and systems could be added/removed, composed by toggling by player
  during runtime, with clean composition ability as well as expandable UI components to manage, change and explore various parameters realtime
  7. Options to import/export state, optionally serialise storyline and replay, determinism (e.g. ability to specify clear initial state and random seed)
  8. Further evolutionary and ecology system depth as modular components / "plugins" based on #6 - everything from making sure there's a robust genotype/phenotype encoding/system to
  sexual reproduction (incl. tracing of lineage) to whatever else
  9. Overall behavioral depth based both on the above as well as on further modular components and various add-on iterations/experiments, from behavior trees to (locally-run) neural
  networks. But also further social dynamics, swarm and flocking behavior, etc.
  10. Expandable more refined statistical analysis features
  11. On the other hand, exploration of aesthetics, generative art and even video game spaces and ideas (from initial placement to overall rehaul of graphics and artistic feel)
  12. More areas?
